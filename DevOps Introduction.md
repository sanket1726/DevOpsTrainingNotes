# DevOps Introduction
    DevOps is a philosophy of the efficient development, deployment, and operation, of the highest quality software possible.

* ## here are a few key performance indicators you should track, to get you started:

    >Frequency of deployments<br>
    > * Deployment frequency otherwise known as throughput, is a measure of how frequently your team deploys code. This metric is often represented as a percentage and it answers the question “how often do we deploy to production or to another significant point in our CD pipeline such as a staging environment?”
    
    >The frequency of failed deployments<br>

    >Mean time to recovery (MTTR)<br>
    > * MTTR (mean time to repair) is the average time it takes to repair a system (usually technical or mechanical). It includes both the repair time and any testing time. The clock doesn’t stop on this metric until the system is fully functional again.
    
    >Mean time to discovery (MTTD)<br>
    > * 
    >Mean time between failures (MTBF) (`total up time / total down time`)
    > * MTBF (mean time between failures) is the average time between repairable failures of a technology product. The metric is used to track both the availability and reliability of a product. The higher the time between failure, the more reliable the system.
    >Lead time<br>
    >Uptime<br>
    >Customer complaint volume<br>
    >Service performance<br>
